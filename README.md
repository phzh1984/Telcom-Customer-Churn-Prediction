# Telcom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer churn is defined as the discontinuation of business between customers or subscribers and a firm or service.

In the telecom industry, customers have a range of service providers to choose from, and they actively switch between them. This sector experiences an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in its highly competitive market.

Customized customer retention poses a challenge due to the large customer base most firms manage, making it unfeasible to allocate extensive time to each individual. The associated costs would outweigh the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could predict which customers are likely to leave in advance, it could concentrate its customer retention efforts specifically on these "high-risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and regain more customer loyalty. The key to success in this market lies within the customer itself.

Customer churn stands as a critical metric because retaining existing customers is significantly less costly than acquiring new ones.

To mitigate customer churn, telecom companies must forecast which customers are at high risk of churning.

To detect early signs of potential churn, it is crucial to first develop a comprehensive view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels. These include store/branch visits, product purchase histories, customer service calls, web-based transactions, and social media interactions, among others.

By addressing churn, these businesses can not only maintain their market position but also grow and prosper. The larger their customer network, the lower the cost of initiation and the greater the profit. Therefore, the company's primary focus for success lies in reducing client attrition and implementing an effective retention strategy.

Goal

The goal is to use this dataset for predictive modeling to anticipate customer churn, enabling the development of targeted customer retention programs and strategies.

The dataset

This dataset is focused on predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. Each row in the dataset represents an individual customer, and the columns encompass various attributes and features of the customers, their services, account information, and demographic data.

Context

The dataset's primary objective is to enable predictive analysis to forecast customer behavior and anticipate churn. It allows for the exploration and analysis of pertinent customer data to develop targeted customer retention strategies.

Content

The dataset comprises 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features). The columns in the dataset contain information about:

Churn: Indicates whether the customer left within the last month. This column serves as the target for prediction.

Services: Details the services each customer has subscribed to, including phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
